## IStaticFeatureDefinition.scopedName property

the feature's name scoped to the package.json package name.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
scopedName: string;
```

## Example

```
packageName = '@some-scope/my-package'
featureName = 'my-feature'
scopedName === 'my-package/my-feature'
```

if package name is equal to the feature name, then the scoped name will just be the package name if package name ends with - feature, we remove it from the scope
