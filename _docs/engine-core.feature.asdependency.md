## Feature.asDependency property

References `this` without the exact types of `Deps` (making them a generic `Feature[]`<!-- -->). We use `someFeature.asEntity` instead of `someFeature` when we want to avoid typescript inlining these types during inference of `.d.ts` files.

Mainly used where a Feature has dependencies:

```ts
new Feature({
   id: 'someFeature',
   dependencies: [anotherFeature.asDependency],
   api: { ... },
})
```

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
asDependency: Dependency<ID, API, EnvironmentContext>;
```
