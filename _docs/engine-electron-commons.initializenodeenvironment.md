## initializeNodeEnvironment variable

Spawn a node-based environment from the renderer process. Should be invoked \*only\* from the renderer process. The caller should await returned `environmentIsReady` promise to ensure environment initialization is finished.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
initializeNodeEnvironment: EnvironmentInitializer<
  {
    id: string;
    dispose: () => void;
    onDisconnect: (cb: () => void) => void;
    environmentIsReady: Promise<void>;
  },
  InitializeNodeEnvironmentOptions
>;
```
