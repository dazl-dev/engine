The engineer is the CLI tool of the engine, It's responsible to compile the application.

2 packages

### CLI

`application` instance 

`start` is located inside the `dev.server` feature

how does the main env receives configuration to the application and how does it knows to communicate with any other node env? 



### Scripts

![[utils.engineer.create#Options]]
![[utils.engineer.start#Options]]
![[utils.engineer.run#Options]]
![[utils.engineer.build#Options]]
![[utils.engineer.clean#Options]]

### Topology

basically it's an output of the entire URL path of the server that is running (Ex: `localhost:3000/server`)
