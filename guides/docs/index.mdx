# Engine

<blockquote style={{ fontSize: '1.6rem' }}>
  <em><strong>Engine</strong></em> is from the Latin <em>ingenium</em>, which referred to one’s ability to create
  things, one’s native genius; it comes from a root meaning <em>'<strong>create</strong>; beget'</em>
</blockquote>

## Approach

- An application is a set of one or more features.
- A feature contains all the integration code required to get a subset of product functionality implemented.
- Features may depend on other features, consume their exposed services and register into their slots.
- A service is a set of functions exposed as an API of a feature.
- A slot is a registry of any type, which allows pluggability via registration.
- Environments (browser/webworker/iframe) are defined by features, and have semantic names (main/processing/preview).
- Each slot and service is available in a specific environment.
- Services can be marked as accessible cross-environments, which exposes them as async APIs in those environment.
