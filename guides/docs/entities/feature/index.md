# Feature

Feature is the main entity in the engine. It is the main building block of the application.

There are two main phases of feature lifecycle, "setup" and "run"

### Setup

The `setup` methods of all features are running in sync and are in the dependency order

### Run

`run` Methods are running in parallel after **all** `setup` methods has finished

A feature is combined of several files:

- `<feature-name>.feature.ts` - feature definition file.
- `<feature-name>.<some-env>.env.ts` - some-env specific setup code.
- `<feature-name>.<another-env>.env.ts` - another-env specific setup code.

### Feature definition file

Feature definition is created in a `<feature-name>.feature.ts` file, and is exposed as the `default` export.

For example:

```ts
/* my-feature.feature.ts */

import { Feature } from '@wixc3/engine-core';

/* defining a new feature */
export default new Feature({
  id: 'myFeature' /* unique id for the feature */,

  dependencies: [
    /* other features the feature depends on */
  ],

  api: {
    /* slots, services, and configurations of the feature */
  },
});
```

`Feature` constructor accepts three options

### `id: string`

Unique identifier, This is the feature name. For example a `file-server` feature will be initiated
as `const fileServerFeature = new Feature({id: 'file-server', ...rest})` and the rest of the folder structure should be
prefixed with `file-server`.

### `Dependencies: []`

Features that this current feature is dependant upon

### `api: Api`

Api implements three types of interfaces:

#### Config

#### Slot

#### Service

Service is a method within an API. When we need to declare API methods we will call the `Service.withType` static.

```typescript
const myFeature = new Feature({
  id: 'myFeature',
  api: {
    echoService: Service.withType < echo()
:
string > ().defineEntity(env1)
},
// etc..
})
```

## `Feature` instance

### setup(env, handler)

This is the method of a feature to set itself up in an [environment](../environment/index.md)

#### arguments

| argument | description                                                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| env      | the [environment](../environment) we want to set the feature up in |
| handler  | [Set up handler](#setup-handler)                                   |

#### Setup handler

The setup handler is a method being called with 3 arguments.

```ts
myFeature.setup(myEnv, (settingUpFeature, dependencies, contexts) => { ... });
```

- **_settingUpFeature_** - an object containing all the entities related to the feature:

| argument  | description                                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id        | _(string)_ - id of the feature                                                                  |
| run       | _(method)_ - a method will be called once this feature is ready in this environment             |
| onDispose | _(method)_ - a method will be called once this feature gets disposed in this environment        |
| Own slots | _(object)_ all the slots defined in the feature api for this environment                        |
| Configs   | _(object)_ all the configurations defined in the feature api and accessible in this environment |

:::tip
`run(cb: Function)`

This will be called when the environment is ready. For example, when we want to render a react component we need the
document to be ready. In this case we will insert all react rendering logic inside the `run` method.
:::

- **_dependencies_** - a list of all the dependencies the feature declared dependency on, and all the api's available
  from that feature in the current environment

- **_contexts_** - APIs provided to the specific environment in case the environment is
  a [contextual environment](../environment/contextual.md).

### setupContext(env, contextName,handler)

In case the environment is a [contextual environment](../environment/contextual.md), this is how we can provide
a specific context to the environment.

```ts
myFeature.setupContext(myEnv, 'envContext', (deps) => {
  return {
    method: () => 'from context',
  };
});
```

##### For an example of a minimal contextual environment look at `/examples/multi-env`
