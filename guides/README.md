# Documentation (guides)

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

Before working, you'd need to run

```shell
yarn workspace engine-guides add @docusaurus/core @docusaurus/preset-classic @docusaurus/theme-mermaid @types/fs-extra
```

after which you can run

```
yarn workspace engine-guides start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.
